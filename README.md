The weather app that I developed using React is a robust and user-friendly application that provides real-time weather data for a user's specified location
The user interface is designed with Pagination, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a seamless and intuitive experience for users. The app allows users to search for weather data by city, state, or zip code
With the weather app, users can view current weather conditions, as well as hourly and daily forecasts for up to five days in advance
